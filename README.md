# balancer
Chemical equation balancer

Takes input in the following form:
python balancer.py [chemical equation]

Where [chemical equation] is some chemical equation in a form like:
H2 + O2 -> H2O

It will then attempt to calculate whole number coefficients to balance the equation. It currently supports elements from Hydrogen to Neon. I created this program for fun while studying for a high school chemistry class, but so far it has worked in all my test cases.
